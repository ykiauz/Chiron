# Chiron

## Introduction
Chiron is a serverless deployment system that implements `wrap`, a novel abstraction for the "m-to-n" serverless deployment model aiming at optimizing performance and resource efficiency by function partition and function execution mode selection, atop OpenFaaS with combined processes and threads.

## Installation
We implement the Chiron system in OpenFaas v0.21.1, and run it on a Kubernetes v1.23.6 cluster. The [Installation](https://github.com/ykiauz/Chiron/tree/main/Installation) shows the instruction to install the environment.

## Benchmark
We provide some benchmark for evaluating our system. The [Benchmark](https://github.com/ykiauz/Chiron/tree/main/Benchmark) shows the instruction to build and deploy several serverless workflows.

## Profiler
This module shows how Chiron profiles a function for further performance prediction. The details can be found in [Profiler](https://github.com/ykiauz/Chiron/tree/main/Profiler).

## Scheduler
This module is core of Chiron, which determines the `wraps` of workflow based on the given SLO. The details can be found in [Scheduler](https://github.com/ykiauz/Chiron/tree/main/Scheduler).

## Generator
This module produces the orchestrator code of `wraps` based on the result of `Scheduler`. The details can be found in [Generator](https://github.com/ykiauz/Chiron/tree/main/Generator).


## Envaluation
This sections contains a simple instruction for replaying our evaluation. The details can be found in [Generator](https://github.com/ykiauz/Chiron/tree/main/Envaluation).
